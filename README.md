## Creative Portion
For the creative portion of this project:

- We implemented a user profile customization feature. Users can now update their profile information, including a bio and social links. This upgrade allows for a more personalized user experience. Press the username once you login to access your profile.

- We also desgiend a simple search engine to find specific titles or stories from certain authors. Press the  "Search for a story" to search, and you can either leave it blank to see all stories, or type to get the best results by title or author.

- We also added a filter for inappropriate words. If you type in common curse words (e.g. "fuck", "shit", "asshole") when editing or creating stories/comments, the words will be censored. This is contigent on your input being delimited by space (e.g. try typing "This is a shit day" as a comment, your output will be "This is a **** day").
